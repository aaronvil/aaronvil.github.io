Configuration managment is very important in keeping projects and other large team collaborations up to date and working perfectly in collaborations. Without it, project between even two people can cause problems where someone code is different from the others while both work on the same file. This could lead in changes that don't mix well with each other and when you collaborate, it can be hard to find what was changed and what works together. Now try imagine that at a larger scale with a team of 10. If all 10 were working on the same file, then you can see how bad things can get. Also keeping track of what changes had been made and where can be very hard when there are multiple people working on multiple files.
