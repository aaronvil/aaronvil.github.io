Configuration managment is very important in keeping projects and other large team collaborations up to date and working perfectly in collaborations. Without it, project between even two people can cause problems where someone code is different from the others while both work on the same file. This could lead in changes that don't mix well with each other and when you collaborate, it can be hard to find what was changed and what works together. Now try imagine that at a larger scale with a team of 10. If all 10 were working on the same file, then you can see how bad things can get. Also keeping track of what changes had been made and where can be very hard when there are multiple people working on multiple files.

One of the most popular cloud systems that is used for configuration managment is GitHub, which uses git as its version control system or VCS. The ease of Github for file sharing and the simplicity of git really makes it easy for someone new to easily get the hang of it, while having a large amount of other option for people who have been using it for a while to find small hack arounds to be more of ease. I feel though that between GitHub and git, the use of git wouldn't have been as popular unless GitHub came around in using it. GitHub makes working in large projects and version control very easy that if they hadn't chosen git, GitHub itself would still be successful using maybe a different VCS, maybe with a different name not as catchy as GitHub. While you can't till which one relied on the other, unless you built some sort of demenisional gateway, it is easy to tell the combination of the fast and easy to use git with the cloud system of GitHub has become a very popular tool in configuration managment.
