UI frameworks, such as Semantic UI can be very useful for anyone that wants to make a website. They can make organizing a website look pretty decent without having to deal with a lot of the css stuff that you would have to deal with if you wanted to make your website look decent. Though sometimes finding out everything that you want to use for your website can be kinda hard to do if you don’t know exactly what you are looking for.

For this past week I have been learning how to use Semantic UI and while using Semantic UI has been helpful when not having to deal a bunch of CSS, it has been kinda hard with just dealing with the syntax for it. There has been moments where I have been looking at my html code trying to find out why the syntax I have in my class is not doing what I am hoping it would do. In almost all these cases, there was a syntax error where I accidently had an extra double quotation mark or misspelled something. Unfortunately these syntax errors are not shown in my code and makes trying to find where in your code something went wrong can be kinda frustrating.

Once you get past the syntax or trying to find the right combination of words in your class to make your page look like you want, it makes designing your websites so much easier. I have done a few examples of looking at a website and copying the website using Semantic UI and have been able to get a somewhat same result as the website I am using for practice. The time it took me to do those websites took little time compared to what it would take for me to change the CSS and have to experiment on what exactly makes the design looks good.

  Overall using a UI framework like Semantic UI has been very helpful when designing a website and has proven to be a quick and easy when trying to design your website. As long as you can get past the fact that some frameworks do not come with a way to check for syntax error besides seeing if the changes you made took place and trying to find which line of code isn’t working. Put after taking the time to learn some of the things that Semantic UI allows me to do I can say that using a UI framework has made the design and layout of a website so much easier than before when I had to do everything through style and css.
