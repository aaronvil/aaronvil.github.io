Growing up , I have always had an interests in computer and it was in college where I became even more interested in programming. It helped that in ICS 111, we were pretty much making games and small little fun applications, which showed how fun programming is.  Continuing on in my classes, I have continued to gain interest in programming and seeing the applications that it can be used for in  both my computer science and electrical engineering classes. It is because of my interest in programming that I decided to choose computer engineering as my major, a combination of ICS and EE.

    Now I have been working on a few projects that has increased my interest, which has been working on a database for my work, which has had me learning several different concepts. Another project is my engineering project on drones where I have worked some of the scripts and algorithms that are being used on the drone. Also the latest project that I am part of for work has me creating the UI for a website and understanding how the business rules for the web app will go.

What I hope to gain in continue learning through software engineering and other computer science classes is a better sense in organizing my projects. Also getting more proficient in writing code in both organization and quickly figuring out a solution to a problem. I know it takes me forever to figure out how to solve a problem when it really shouldnâ€™t. I am hoping that I will learn even more concepts and other materials that will increase my interest in computers and programming.
