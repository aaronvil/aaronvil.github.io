### Working with meteor

For the past couple of weeks, I have been dealing with meteor in my software engineering class. I have been able to get a little more comfortable with the framework enough to compare it to other frameworks I have dealt with before tackling meteor. First of all is my first thought on meteor by itself.

### Meteor by itself
First of all meteor was a little hard getting use to after using a different framework., but that comes from switching from two different frameworks. It is similar from playing the clarinet, then going to play the saxophone. There are similarity between the two but enough differences that it takes a little while getting use to when switching. Purely by itself there seem to be a lot to meteor, with dealing with the way all the file directories work or making sure all the files are properly imported. I found that making sure all the files are correctly imported to the correct index.js file was an easy thing to forget and would then cause certain pages and javascript files to not work the way it should because of a simple mistake. Also making sure the router is correct is another that has caused mistakes for when I am trying to make a page and making sure that the page url is working correctly. Though a lot of other frameworks also have that, which I have made the same mistakes for those other frameworks as well.


### Meteor compared to others
Now comparing it to other frameworks I have used, I feel like meteor is the one I like the least. I have worked both with spring and grails before. Spring more current, because I am also using it at the same time as meteor, just that I have started spring before meteor. When it comes to grails on intellij, making pages and controllers for app was really easy. Thanks to intellij, it makes it so easy that it almost does it for me. For spring it is like meteor where you have to make the correct files but I have felt that it has less file directories than I have to deal with in meteor. While meteor isnâ€™t that difficult to deal with, I just felt that compared to the other frameworks that I have tried meteor felt the most cumbersome of the three.
