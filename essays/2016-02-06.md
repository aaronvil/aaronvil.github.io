I am somewhat familiar with dealing with javascript, seeing it in other projects but never really fully understand the concepts of javascript. I have used it for hiding certain data in a table or buttons if a certain condition has been met. I have also had some familiarity with ES5 javascript when learning about Angular 2 that I was using for one of my projects for work.

    Comparing it to other languages, I would say that javascript feels really familiar to java, which would be no surprise.  Also since it is a sub set of typescript, it also feels familiar to what I have learned in that. Now whether javascript is good for software engineering, that would be hard to say. In terms of learning concepts for software engineering, then yes since the language isn’t too difficult to learn.

        Now on the question on the athletic software engineering we are doing in our ICS 314 class, do I find it useful in the learning process. I find that the process and the WOD’s that we do as helpful in the learning process. Rather than learning about a concept, it is better for someone to learn and remember by actually doing said concepts. It also help those who learn best by doing, like me.
