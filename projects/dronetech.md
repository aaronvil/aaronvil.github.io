summary: A UH Manoa VIP project that combines a number of computer engineers, mechanical engineers and electrical engineers building an automous air drone for the AUSVI competition.
---

This VIP project has students do the design, fabrication, testing, and analysis of unmanned aerial systems (drones) using autonomous surveillance and image detection to aid in search-and-rescue (SAR) relief efforts. Drones provide the stability and maneuverability to survey specified areas, while improving both efficiency and cost of current SAR methods. To maximize efficiency, a drone must be designed to be both lightweight and power efficient, while also employing intelligent navigational algorithms and robust image processing.
