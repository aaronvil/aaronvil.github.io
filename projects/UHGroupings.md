summary:Create a sophisticated, yet easy to use online tool for managing Grouper-based authorization groups.  Grouper provides a robust interface and exposes tens of thousands of groups, but it is intimidating in its immensity.  UH Groupings is designed to hide a lot of detail while at the same time making group management easy for a UH Groupings owner.  UH Groupings includes features such as LISTSERV list publication so that a UH Grouping is also inherently useful for communications.
