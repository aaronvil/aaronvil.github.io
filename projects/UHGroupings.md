summary: A sophisticated, yet easy to use online tool for managing Grouper-based authorization groups.
---

Grouper provides a robust interface and exposes tens of thousands of groups, but it is intimidating in its immensity.  UH Groupings is designed to hide a lot of detail while at the same time making group management easy for a UH Groupings owner.  UH Groupings includes features such as LISTSERV list publication so that a UH Grouping is also inherently useful for communications.  

With UH Groupings, advanced functionality such as "provide me with an automatically updated UH Grouping that includes ITS staff on the 5th floor currently enrolled in classes and therefore eligible for a tuition waiver" is easily accomplished thanks to the Group Store and Grouper mathematics.  In addition, the UH Grouping owner can manually augment the group by manually adding or excluding individuals, which is very helpful for fine-tuning membership without giving up membership automation by UHIMS.
